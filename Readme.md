# **HTLigt**
A Project made in the [HTL Steyr](https://www.htl-steyr.ac.at/) in the year 2026. 

The school was looking for a new workshop project for first-year students. As part of their engineering project, students Konstantin Schwödiauer, Thomas Zeiler, and Fabian Lenhart developed a desk lamp called HTLlight. This lamp is not switched on using a switch, but by touching a metal part of the housing, which also allows the brightness to be adjusted.


This works via human hum voltage (Brummspannung). This means that due to water in the fingers and the creation of a small capacity, the human body always emits a small electrical impulse. This electrical impulse is detected and processed by the circuit.
